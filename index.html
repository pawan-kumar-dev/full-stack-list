        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
        web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
        within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
        and data tables.

    <div id="css">
      <h4>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements
        are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot
        of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

    <div id="js">
      <h4>
        JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the
        client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages
        interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and
        style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that
        engage a user.

      <h4>
        React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building
        user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. ... React
        allows developers to create large web applications that can change data,
        without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast,
        scalable, and simple.

    </div>
    <div id="node">
      <h4>
        Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due
        to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and
        back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based
        architectures in mind.
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="express">
      <h4>
        The primary use of Express is to provide server-side logic for web and
        mobile applications, and as such it's used all over the place.

    <div id="mongo">
      <h4>
        When needed, MongoDB can coordinate and control changes to the structure
        of documents using schema validation. MongoDB created Binary JSON format
        (BSON) to increase efficiency and support more data types. Data stored
        in BSON can be searched and indexed, tremendously increasing
        performance.
